DevOpsGirls Bootcamp is composed of three primary modules with an additional modules available for those looking to take on a bit more.

1. What are EC2 instances?

1. What is an ELB?

1. How do I automate this with Auto Scaling Groups?

Each of the modules represents a continuing improvement on a blog website - a blog that you can login to, and post things in. With each module, we're making the blog more automated, more resilient, and more durable to issues.

## Bootcamp 3

We will deploy a website the cloud using three different and interesting methods:

1.  Deploy your site to a server!

1.  Deploy your site to a container (woah!!)

1.  Deploy a serverless site!!!

Each of these approaches has a different set of use cases and you will be able to recognize the value that each option provides.
