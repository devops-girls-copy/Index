DevOpsGirls Bootcamp is composed of three primary modules with an additional modules available for those looking to take on a bit more.

1. What are EC2 instances?

1. What is an ELB?

1. How do I automate this with Auto Scaling Groups?

Each of the modules represents a continuing improvement on a blog website - a blog that you can login to, and post things in. With each module, we're making the blog more automated, more resilient, and more durable to issues.
